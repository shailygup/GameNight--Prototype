Summary:
We were quite fast to grasp the new concepts, therefore it didn't take us much long to develop the app. The one part that we did struggle on was the calendar. It took us an entire week to get that working. While, all our other stuff was finished in 2-4 days. Because we had some time left on our hands, we tried to tackle the social media part of the project. We weren't quite successful to accomplish that. Next time we hope to get better understanding of how to do the social media component and how would it be implemented via our code.
